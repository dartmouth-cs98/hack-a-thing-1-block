## Description

I worked ona tutorial for Corda. Corda is a platform for making blockchain applications. I also reserched Corda and read whitepaper/documentation. During 
the tutorial I implemented basic code and then put that code through several pre-written tests.

## Learned

In the tutorial I learned how to implementa Cordapp. A cordapp is the logic behind transactions on the blockchain. This included creating a state, contract and flow.
A state object are the "things" on  the blockchain like coins. A contract checks for transactoin veractity. A flow contains logic which guides a transcation.
I leanred how Corda works, what algortithms they uses to find consensus, and possible technologies they use. I learned about how nodes on the netword communicate.


## What didn't Work

I simply used a tutorial. There is a lot more I would neeed to learn to implement a sucessful cordapp.
It would  take much work to do make a useful product using cordapp.
